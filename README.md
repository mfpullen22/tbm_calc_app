# TB Meningitis Risk Calculator

This app is built to allow for offline use the the TB Mengitis Risk Calculator, using the latest research by Dr. Anna Stadelman-Behar PhD. The research supporting this calculator can be found at [https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.23-0789](https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.23-0789). 

Using this app, you can input patient-specific data points and generate an approximate risk of TB meningitis using common diagnostic measures in this patient population. The hope is that by putting this tool in the hands of clinicians worldwide, we can help them diagnose TB meningitis earlier and more reliably, thus saving lives in settings where diagnostic uncertainty is common.
